# INTRODUCTION

This project serves showcases the end-to-end process of developing, validating, and deploying a machine learning model using SKLearn on AWS SageMaker. The application of which is in the domain of computer security - having a usecase of Malware Detection. Through this demonstration, we navigate the complete lifecycle of a model, from its initial training and testing phases to its deployment in a production environment. This project not only illustrates the technical intricacies of model development but also supports real-world applicability and versatility of deploying machine learning solutions on cloud platforms like AWS SageMaker.

# LAB 5.4 STATIC MALWARE DETECTOR

You can get the training model used as a Random Forest Classifier along with the codebase and the sample dataset (including all benign and malicious software) in the link [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/aiec-s24/4-%20Training%20a%20Static%20Malware%20Detector.zip)

# DEPLOYMENT

Now that we have our model ready, we deploy it using an endpoint created on AWS Sagemaker to handle input data which will be provided by our python client. These files are then compressed into a model archive which is then later uploaded to an S3 bucket for deployment purposes.

# CLIENT

The final stage of deployment is to create a python client for interaction with the model and then invoke a backend for the web application client. This client will fetch the data from uploaded PE executable and then send the features gathered from the executable to the Sagemaker endpoint for inference. Based on the model, the client shall output whether the file is malicious or benign.
