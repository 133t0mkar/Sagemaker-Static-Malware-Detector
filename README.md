# INTRODUCTION

This project serves showcases the end-to-end process of developing, validating, and deploying a machine learning model using SKLearn on AWS SageMaker. The application of which is in the domain of computer security - having a usecase of Malware Detection. Through this demonstration, we navigate the complete lifecycle of a model, from its initial training and testing phases to its deployment in a production environment. This project not only illustrates the technical intricacies of model development but also supports real-world applicability and versatility of deploying machine learning solutions on cloud platforms like AWS SageMaker.
